REMINDER: remove all the debug puts calls...

============================== FACEBOOK RAILS CONTROLLER EXTENSIONS NOTES ==============================


============================== FACEBOOK PLATFORM NOTES ==============================


============================== IMPORTANT NOTES ==============================


** THIS IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE WHO USED THE OLD CLIENT WHEN IT WAS CALLED "RBook" **

[1] The RBook name was already taken, so now you need to change any "RBook" references to "RFacebook"

[2] The desktop app login process is much simpler now:

	fbsession = RFacebook::FacebookDesktopSession.new(APIKEY, APISECRET)
	puts fbsession.get_login_url # tell the user to login at this url
	# ...after the user logs in...
	fbsession.activate

[3] The "init_with_token" method is now "activate_with_token" (it is a little less confusing with this naming)

[4] A helpful "NotActivatedException" will be raised if you forget to activate your session in one of the following ways:

		Web: you must call either "activate_with_token" or "activate_with_previous_session"
		Desktop: you must call either "activate" or "activate_with_previous_session"

[5] Infinite sessions are now supported (web and desktop)...

		Web:
		
			(a) Save the session key to a file or something
				(i.e. "keyToSave = fbsession.session_key")
				
			(b) Normally, you would redirect the user to "get_login_url" and then call "activate_with_token" after the callback.
				With an infinite session, skip these two steps and call "fbsession.activate_with_previous_session(keyToSave)" instead.
		
		Desktop:
		
			(a) Save the session key and session secret to a file or something
				(i.e. "keyToSave = fbsession.session_key" and "secretToSave = fbsession.session_secret")
			
			(b) Normally, you would redirect the user to "get_login_url" and then call "activate".
				With an infinite session, skip these two steps and call "fbsession.activate_with_previous_session(keyToSave, secretToSave)" instead.

Some code was inspired by techniques used in Alpha Chen's old client.
Some code was ported from the official PHP5 client.
