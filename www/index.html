		<h1>What is RFacebook?</h1>
			
		<a id="CurrentVersionBox" href="http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=3607">
			<span class="message">gem version</span>
			<br/>
			<span class="number">0.9.5</span>
		</a>
			
		<p>
			RFacebook is a <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a> interface to the
			<a href="http://developers.facebook.com/documentation.php">Facebook API</a>.
			It hides all the nitty-gritty details behind a beautiful
			Ruby front-end, allowing you to focus on writing great code.
		</p>
		
		<p>			
			And now, with the <a href="quickstart.html">RFacebook on Rails</a> plugin,
			you can have even more Facebook goodness in Rails.  Besides extensions for controllers, views, models, and sessions, it even
			has a great <a href="debugpanel.html">debug panel</a> that lets you see what's going on behind the scenes.
		
		</p>
		<p>
			RFacebook is a production-ready library that has been deployed in a number of high-profile
			applications, such as <a href="http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?id=2318966938&b&ref=pd">Causes</a>.
			The combination of <strong>extensive unit tests</strong> and a <a href="features.html">full feature set</a> make it the
			most complete Facebook library for Rails.
		</p>
		
		<h1>How do I use RFacebook?</h1>
		
		<p>
			If you are a Rails programmer, you'll want to go directly to the <a href="quickstart.html">QuickStart</a>.
			This describes how to install the <strong>RFacebook Gem</strong> and the <strong>RFacebook on Rails Plugin</strong>.
			It also covers the basic features available in your models, views, and controllers.
		</p>
		<p>
			After checking that out, you might want to peruse some <a href="facebookapi.html">sample API calls</a>, as well
			as try out the <a href="tunnel.html">SSH tunnel</a> and the <a href="debugpanel.html">debug panel</a>.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			If you really want to get into the details, go to the <a href="doc/">full RFacebook RDoc documentation</a>.
		</p>
		
		<h1>Where can I get help?</h1>
		<p>
			In general, bugs and patches will be addressed within a week.  However, you will always
			want to check out the <a href="http://facebook.jdg.net">forums</a> to see if your
			problem already has a solution to it.  The people there are generally friendly and quite helpful.
			If you do find a bug, please <a href="http://rubyforge.org/tracker/?func=add&group_id=3607&atid=13796">submit a bug report</a>
			so that it can be fixed right away.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			You can also check out the
			<a href="http://rubyforge.org/frs/download.php/23678/rfacebook_on_rails_sample.zip">sample RFacebook on Rails application</a>
			if you're having trouble getting started.
		</p>

		
		<h1>How can I contribute?</h1>
		<p>
			Maintaining RFacebook is not a trivial thing.  There are many different ways to
			make a Facebook application (canvas, iframe, and external), and there are also tons of
			obscure Rails components and plugins that need to be supported.  All of this needs to
			<strong>work seamlessly together</strong> in a single library.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you are an experienced Rails programmer, we'd love to have you <a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/rfacebook">contribute to the
			project</a>.  Even if it's just the occasional patch, every bit counts.
			In particular, we need developers <strong>working on IFRAME applications</strong>
			as well as a developer who is familiar with <strong>Rails unit testing that simulates external APIs</strong> (like Facebook's).
